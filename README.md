# SomeResolver

---
I decided to try my hand at writing a, very, simple DI resolver - this is the result.
You should probably not use this.

## What you can expect, should you use it:
1. A lack of unit tests.
2. At least a handful of bugs.
3. A lack of features.

## Future...?
I'll probably update, tweak and play with the code but no promises.
Some future features I might add:
- Resolving collections of dependencies.
- Adding the ability to specify an implementation factory when registering a dependency.
- Instance lifecycle management.
- Ease of use functionality/extensions.
